/**
 * Generate and collate feature importance information from the XGBoost model. This wraps the underlying functionality
 * of the XGBoost model, and should provide feature importance metrics compatible with those provided by XGBoost's R
 * and Python APIs. For a more treatment of what the different importance metrics mean and how to interpret them, see
 * <a href="https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/R-package/discoverYourData.html">here</a>. In brief
 *
 * <ul>
 *     <li><b>Gain</b> measures the improvement in accuracy that a feature brings to the branches on which it appears.
 *     This represents the sum of situated marginal contributions that a given feature makes to the each branching
 *     chain in which it appears.</li>
 *     <li><b>Cover</b> measures the number of examples a given feature discriminates across, relative to the total
 *     number of examples all features discriminate across.</li>
 *     <li><b>Weight</b> measures the number a times a feature occurs in the model. Due to the way the model builds trees,
 *     this value is skewed in favor of continuous features.</li>
 *     <li><b>Total Gain</b> is similar to gain, but not locally averaged by weight, and thus not skewed in the way that
 *     weight can be skewed.</li>
 *     <li><b>Total Cover</b> is similar to cover, but not locally averaged by weight, and thus not skewed in the way that
