    "# Document Classification\n",
    "This tutorial will show how to perform document classification in Tribuo, using a variety of different methods to extract features from the text. We'll use the venerable [20-newsgroups dataset](http://qwone.com/~jason/20Newsgroups/) where the task is to predict what newsgroup a particular post is from, though this tutorial would be equally applicable to any document classification task (including tasks like sentiment analysis). We're going to train a simple logistic regression with fixed hyperparameters using a variety of feature extraction methods. The aim is to show how to extract features from text rather than focusing on the performance, as using a more powerful model like XGBoost, or performing hyperparameter optimization on the logisitic regression will likely improve the performance of all the feature extraction techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll need a copy of the 20 newsgroups dataset, so first download and unpack it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "wget http://qwone.com/~jason/20Newsgroups/20news-bydate.tar.gz\n",
    "mkdir 20news\n",
    "cd 20news\n",
    "tar -zxf ../20news-bydate.tar.gz\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This leaves you with two directories `20news-bydate-train` and `20news-bydate-test`, which contain the standard train and test split for this data.\n",
    "\n",
    "20 newsgroups comes in a fairly standard format, the dataset is represented by a set of directories where the directory name is the class label, and the directory contains a collection of documents with one document in each file. Each file is a single Usenet post. For the purposes of this tutorial, we'll use the subject and body of the post as the input text for classification.\n",

    "# Extracting features from text\n",
    "Much of the work of machine learning is in presenting an appropriate representation of the data to the model. This is especially true when working with text data, as there is a plethora of approaches for converting text into the numbers that ML algorithms operate on. The `DirectoryFileSource` allows the user to choose the feature extraction, as it requires a `TextFeatureExtractor` which converts the `String` representing the input text into a Tribuo `Example`. We'll cover several different implementations of the `TextFeatureExtractor` interface in this tutorial, and we expect that users will implement it in their own classes to cope with specific feature extraction requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start with the simplest approach, a \"bag of words\", where each document is represented by the counts of the words in that document. This means the feature space is equal to the number of words, and most documents only have a positive value for a small number of words (as most words don't appear in any given document). This is particularly well suited to Tribuo's sparse vector representation of examples, and this suitability for NLP tasks is the reason that Tribuo is designed this way. Of course, first we'll need to tell the extractor what a word is, and for this we use a `Tokenizer`. Tokenizers split up a `String` into a stream of tokens. Tribuo provides several basic tokenizers, and an interface for tokenization. We're going to use Tribuo's `UniversalTokenizer` which is descended from tokenizers developed at Sun Labs in the 90s, and used in a variety of Sun products since that time. First we'll use a strict bag of words where each feature takes the value `1` if that word is present in the document, and `0` otherwise. We'll use Tribuo's `BasicPipeline` which can convert `String`s into features, and pass it to the basic `TextFeatureExtractor` implementation, helpfully called `TextFeatureExtractorImpl`."

We're going to use a specific preprocessor (`NewsPreprocessor`) which standardises the 20 newsgroups data by stripping out the mail headers and returning only the subject and the body of the email. We'll also lowercase all the text using the `CasingPreprocessor` to slightly reduce the space we're working in. In general the preprocessors are dataset and task specific, which is why Tribuo doesn't ship with many implementations as in most cases users will need to write one from scratch for their specific task."

This is because despite there being more information in the features, there are also many, many more features making it easier to confuse this simple linear model plus each example takes longer to process due to the greatly increased number of features. We could look at using a more complex model like boosted trees to exploit this additional information which may increase the performance back above our baseline. We could further increase number of n-gram features but we'll start to see diminishing returns even with more powerful models as the dimensionality of the feature space increases without a commensurate increase in training data.\n",

A popular way to deal with this is to scale the term frequencies (i.e., the n-gram counts) by the Inverse Document Frequency (or IDF), producing TF-IDF vectors. In Tribuo the IDF is a transformation which is applied separately to the dataset after it's constructed, as it uses aggregate information from the whole dataset which isn't available until all the examples have been loaded in. Let's see how that affects performance."

    "As with the feature hashing above, this model trains more quickly because there is less data to process, but the speed improvement is more substantial as the number of features in each example is lower (because the hashing produces a denser example than trimming out infrequent features). Performance dropped slightly as compared to the TF-IDF model, but again it is around 10% of the parameters, with a corresponding reduction in memory and runtime in inference and training. Performance is improved over the hashing as we're not colliding features at random, we're simply removing ones which are infrequent. If a feature is infrequent we probably can't estimate the weight for it very well so it helps remove some of the noise.\n",

    "## Word embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "All the approaches described above have no notion of word similarity, they rely upon exactly the same words with the same spelling appearing in the training and test documents, when in practice word similarity is likely to be very useful information for the classifier because no two documents use exactly the same phrasing. For example, the unigrams \"excellent\" and \"fantastic\" are equally dissimilar to an n-gram model, when in fact those words are quite similar in meaning. Adding notions of word similarity to ML models usually means embedding each word into some vector space, then words with similar meanings can be close in the vector space, and words with dissimilar or opposite meanings are far apart. There are many popular word embedding algorithms, like [Word2Vec](https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3781), [GloVe](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/) or [FastText](https://fasttext.cc/) which build embeddings on a corpus of text that can then be used in downstream tasks. Tribuo doesn't have a class which can directly load those word vectors, as they all come in different file formats, but it's pretty straightforward to build a `TextFeatureExtractor` that will tokenize the input text, look up each word or n-gram in the vector space and then average them across the input (it took us about an afternoon to build one for our internal word2vec style word vector research file format). If there is interest from the community in supporting a specific word vector file format, we're happy to accept PRs that add the support.\n",
    "\n",
    "While these more traditional forms of word vector are very powerful, as they are precomputed they treat each word the same no matter the context it appears in. For example \"bank\" could mean a river bank, or a financial institution, but a word2vec vector has to contain both meanings because it doesn't know the *context* the word is present in, i.e., the rest of the sentence. This led to the rise of *contextual* word embeddings, which produce a vector for each word based on the whole input sequence. The most popular of these embeddings are based on the [Transformer](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2017/hash/3f5ee243547dee91fbd053c1c4a845aa-Abstract.html) architecture, usually a variant of Google's [BERT](https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/11/open-sourcing-bert-state-of-art-pre.html) model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using BERT embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "BERT is a multi-layer transformer network, which reads in a sentence and produces both an embedding of the sentence, along with embeddings for each wordpiece. A \"wordpiece\" is the token that BERT operates on, which is either a whole word, or a chunk of a word, emitted by the wordpiece tokenizer. The word chunking algorithm is trained on a large corpus and allows common prefixes & suffixes (e.g. \"un\", \"ing\") to be split off the words and to share state. We can use BERT to produce a single vector which represents the sentence or document and then use that vector as features in a downstream Tribuo classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tribuo works with BERT models that are stored in [ONNX format](https://onnx.ai), and can load in tokenizers produced by [HuggingFace Transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers/). That package also helpfully provides a Python script to convert BERT models from HuggingFace format into ONNX format for deployment. We provide a `TextFeatureExtractor` implementation called `BERTFeatureExtractor` which can produce sentence embeddings out by passing the text through a BERT model. Tribuo uses Microsoft's [ONNX Runtime](https://www.onnxruntime.ai/) to load the model, and has it's own implementation of the Wordpiece tokenization algorithm, along with the necessary glue to produce tokens in the format that BERT expects. One downside of BERT models is that they have a maximum document length that they can process, usually 512 wordpieces. This is configurable in Tribuo's extractor, but if you set the maximum length to be longer than the sequences the model was trained on then the performance is likely to suffer (or the computation may fail depending on how that specific BERT model is implemented).\n",
    "\n",
    "To follow along with this part of the tutorial you'll need to produce a BERT model in onnx format. To do that you'll need access to a Python 3 environment with HuggingFace and PyTorch or TensorFlow installed to export the model (the snippet below assumes PyTorch, change the `pt` to `tf` if you're using TensorFlow). Running the following snippet will produce a `bert-base-uncased.onnx` file that we can use for the rest of the tutorial. You'll need to run it in an empty directory due to the way HuggingFace's conversion script works.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "python -m transformers.convert_graph_to_onnx --framework pt --model bert-base-uncased bert-base-uncased.onnx\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll also need to download the `tokenizer.json` that goes with the BERT variant you are using, for `bert-base-uncased` that file is [here](https://huggingface.co/bert-base-uncased/raw/main/tokenizer.json). Assuming both of those files are now in the same directory as this tutorial, we can create the `BERTFeatureExtractor`. We're going to take the average token embedding across the whole input, as the `[CLS]` token which provides the sentence embedding  tends to perform poorly unless it is fine-tuned on your task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Warning: this feature extraction step took more than a minute per newsgroup on a 2019 16\" 6-core MacBook Pro (using the default settings of ONNX Runtime i.e., using a single thead on the CPU provider) so around 55 minutes to extract the full train and test datasets. Your mileage may vary, and your laptop may get quite warm. We recommend not running it while your laptop is actually on your lap. At the moment Tribuo's `TextFeatureExtractor` interface doesn't batch up the inputs, which limits the performance of contextual feature extractors. We'll look at expanding that interface to support batching in a future release. The session options used can be controlled by the `BERTFeatureExtractor.reconfigureOrtSession(SessionOptions options)` method, which allows the use of whatever configuration is supported by your ONNX Runtime jar."

    "We get around 71% accuracy using this standard BERT model, which might be due to it's training data of Wikipedia and books not overlapping well with the comparatively old newsgroup language. Fine tuning the BERT model on a large corpus of newsgroups could probably improve this, but the standard model is likely to work well for more well formed text like news articles or more formal documents. Alternatively it may be that the logistic regression we're training isn't sufficiently flexible to use the information in the BERT features, so it may be beneficial to use a more complex classifier like gradient boosted trees or a Multi-Layer Perceptron through Tribuo's TensorFlow interface.\n",

However BERT based feature extractors will always be slower than the simpler BoW approaches described above, because they have to perform lots of floating point computations to compute the embedded feature values.\n",

    "\n",
    "We looked at a document classification task in Tribuo. As most of the work in NLP tends to be on featurising the data, we discussed several different ways of converting text into features for use in machine learning. We looked at Bag of Words models, using n-grams, term frequencies, TFIDF vectors, feature hashing and also looked at trimming large feature spaces based on the number of times we'd seen a feature. We also discussed word vector approaches, and showed how to use the popular contextual word embedding model, BERT, to extract features for document classification. It's worth noting all the models trained were simple logistic regressions, with no parameter tuning. Using a more powerful classifier like XGBoost, or performing hyperparameter tuning on the logistic regression will likely improve performance over the simple baselines presented here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tribuo's text processing framework is very flexible, and it's possible to insert your own code into each of the different classes by implementing `TextFeatureExtractor`, `TextPipeline` or even the `Tokenizer` yourself, while the provenance system ensures that you can always recover how your data was processed to ensure it matches at inference time."
