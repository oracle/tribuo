    "# Working with external models\n",
    "Tribuo can load in models trained in third party systems and deploy them alongside native Tribuo models. In Tribuo 4.1 we support models trained externally in [XGBoost](https://xgboost.ai), [TensorFlow](https://tensorflow.org) frozen graphs & saved models, and models stored in ONNX (Open Neural Network eXchange) format. The latter is particularly interesting for Tribuo as many libraries can export models in ONNX format, such as [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org), [pytorch](https://pytorch.org), TensorFlow among others. For a more complete list of the supported onnx models you can look at the [ONNX website](https://onnx.ai). Tribuo's ONNX support is supplied by [ONNX Runtime](https://microsoft.github.io/onnxruntime/), using the Java interface our group in Oracle Labs contributed to that project.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we'll look at loading in models trained in XGBoost, scikit-learn and pytorch, all for MNIST and we'll deploy them next to a logistic regression model trained in Tribuo. We discuss using external TensorFlow models in the [TensorFlow tutorial](https://github.com/oracle/tribuo/blob/main/tutorials/tensorflow-tribuo-v4.ipynb), as TensorFlow brings it's own complexities. Note these models all depend on native libraries, which are available for x86\\_64 platforms on Windows, Linux and macOS. Both ONNX Runtime and XGBoost support macOS arm64 (i.e., Apple Silicon Macs), but you'll need to compile those from source and add them to Tribuo's class path to make this tutorial run on that platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Feature names and feature indices\n",
    "Most of the difficulty in loading in third party models comes in dealing with how the features are presented to the model and how the outputs are read back. If the host system thinks feature `num_wheels` has index `5`, but the third party model expects feature `num_wheels` to have index `10` then the indices need to be transformed before the model can be used for inference. Similarly if the third party model assigns class `car` to index `0` and class `bike` to index `1`, then the host system must know that mapping to return the correct outputs otherwise it could confuse the two classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most ML libraries work purely with feature indices, so this task becomes a matter of ensuring the indices line up. However the model won't raise an exception if the indices don't line up, all it can check is if the number of features in an example matches the number it's expecting, it doesn't know if the indicies themselves line up with the right feature values. Tribuo avoids problems with feature indices (which can be particularly tricky in sparse problems like natural language processing) by naming all the features, the indices assigned to those names are an internal implementation detail which Tribuo users don't need to know about. Unfortunately when loading a third party model we require that the user tells us the mapping from Tribuo's feature names to the external model's feature indices, and also from output indices to output names or labels. Presenting this information to Tribuo is the tricky part of working with external models as it requires understanding how Tribuo's feature names are generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "As usual we add some jar files to the classpath and import some classes from Tribuo and the JDK. We'll pull in the classification experiments jar as that contains XGBoost, and the ONNX jar containing Tribuo's interface to ONNX Runtime."

    "## Loading in an ONNX model\n",
    "ONNX models can encapsulate both neural network and more traditional ML models, and as such they have more complex inputs and outputs. An ONNX model can accept tensor inputs of arbitrary dimension, unlike XGBoost which only accepts feature vectors. Also different ONNX models accept different tensors even for the same task. For example when training an MNIST model in scikit-learn the model expects a feature vector `[784]`, whereas if you train a CNN using pytorch on the same task it will expect a batch of inputs of size `[batch_size,1,28,28]`, in the standard `[batch,channels,height,width]` format. This means we need different input preprocessing logic to ensure that the tensors are formatted appropriately. In Tribuo this is controlled by supplying the appropriate implementation of `ExampleTransformer`. We supply two implementations, one for generating feature vectors and one for generating 4d tensors (i.e., image batches). Similar to the XGBoost model above we also need a converter from the ONNX output format into a Tribuo `Prediction`, which is encapsulated in the `OutputTransformer` interface. We supply two implementations, one for classification and one for regression. The classification one is further specialised as it accepts both scikit-learn style outputs (which produce a map from id to probability) and pytorch style outputs (which return a float matrix). If your ONNX model produces other outputs then you'll need to write your own converter.\n",
