    "## Dataset\n",
    "Tribuo's anomaly detection package comes with a simple data generator that emits pairs of datasets containing 5 features. The training data is free from anomalies, and each example is sampled from a 5 dimensional gaussian with fixed mean and diagonal covariance. The test data is sampled from a mixture of two distributions, the first is the same as the training distribution, and the second uses a different mean for the gaussian (keeping the same covariance for simplicity). All the data points sampled from the second distribution are marked `ANOMALOUS`, and the other points are marked `EXPECTED`. These form the two classes for Tribuo's anomaly detection system. You can also use any of the standard data loaders to pull in anomaly detection data.\n",
