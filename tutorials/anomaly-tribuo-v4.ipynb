    "## Dataset\n",
    "Tribuo's anomaly detection package comes with a simple data source that samples data points from a mixture of two spherical gaussians. One gaussian is expected, and the other is anomalous. The fraction of each present in any given data source is controllable with the `fractionAnomalous` constructor argument. The means and variances of the expected and anomalous distributions are also controllable on construction or via configuration (see the Configuration tutorial for more details on Tribuo's configuration system). All the data points sampled from the second distribution are marked `ANOMALOUS`, and the other points are marked `EXPECTED`. These form the two classes for Tribuo's anomaly detection system. You can also use any of the standard data loaders to pull in anomaly detection data.\n",
