We’ll experiment with several different regression trainers: two for training linear models (SGD and Adagrad) and one for training a tree ensemble via Tribuo’s wrapper on XGBoost. We’ll run these experiments by simply swapping in different implementations of Tribuo’s `Trainer` interface. We’ll also show how to evaluate regression models and describe some common evaluation metrics.\n",

    "Those numbers seem poor, but what do these evaluation metrics mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "### RMSE\n",
    "\n",
    "The root-mean-square error (RMSE) summarizes the magnitude of errors between our regression model's predictions and the values we observe in our data. Basically, RMSE is the standard deviation of model prediction errors on a given dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$RMSE = \\sqrt{ \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2 }$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Lower is better: a perfect model for the wine data would have RMSE=0. The RMSE is sensitive to how large an error was, and is thus sensitive to outliers. This also means that RMSE can be used to compare different models on the same dataset but not across different datasets, as a \"good\" RMSE value on one dataset might be larger than a \"good\" RMSE value on a different dataset. See [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root-mean-square_deviation) for more info on RMSE.\n",
    "\n",
    "### MAE\n",
    "\n",
    "The mean absolute error (MAE) is another summary of model error. Unlike RMSE, each error in MAE contributes proportional to its absolute value. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$MAE = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} |y_i - \\hat{y}_i|$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### R^2\n",
    "\n",
    "The R-squared metric (also called the \"coefficient of determination\") summarizes how much of the variation in observed outcomes can be explained by our model. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let $\\bar{y} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i$, i.e. the mean deviation of observed data points from the observed mean. R^2 is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$R^2 = 1 - \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\bar{y})^2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "A value of R^2=1 means that the model accounts for all of the variation in a set of observations -- in other words, it fits a dataset perfectly. Note that R^2 can turn negative when the sum-of-squared model errors (numerator) is greater than the sum-of-squared differences between observed data points and the observed mean (denominator). In other words, when R^2 is negative, the model fits the data *worse* than simply using the observed mean to predict values.\n",
    "\n",
    "See [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_determination) and the [Minitab blog](https://blog.minitab.com/blog/adventures-in-statistics-2/regression-analysis-how-do-i-interpret-r-squared-and-assess-the-goodness-of-fit) for more detailed discussion of R^2.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Improving over standard SGD with AdaGrad\n",
    "\n",
    "It's not surprising the SGD results are bad: in linear decay SGD, the step size used for parameter updates changes over time (training iterations) but is uniform across all model parameters. This means that we use the same step size for a noisy/irrelevant feature as we would for an informative feature. There many more sophisticated approaches to gradient descent. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of these is [AdaGrad](http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume12/duchi11a/duchi11a.pdf), modifies the \"global\" learning rate for each parameter $p$ using the sum-of-squares of past gradients w.r.t. $p$, up to time $t$. \n",
