    "This guide will show how to use Tribuo’s regression models to predict wine quality based on the [UCI Wine Quality](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality) data set. We’ll experiment with several different regression trainers: two for training linear models (SGD and Adagrad) and one for training a tree ensemble via Tribuo’s wrapper on XGBoost (note: Tribuo's XGBoost support relies upon the Maven Central XGBoost jar which only contains binaries for x86_64 platforms). We’ll run these experiments by simply swapping in different implementations of Tribuo’s `Trainer` interface.

    "## Loading the data\n",
    "In Tribuo, all the prediction types have an associated `OutputFactory` implementation, which can create the appropriate `Output` subclasses from an input. Here we're going to use `RegressionFactory` as we're performing regression. In Tribuo both single and multidimensional regression use the `Regressor` and `RegressionFactory` classes. We then pass the `regressionFactory` into the simple `CSVLoader` which reads all the columns into a `DataSource`. The winequality dataset uses `;` to separate the columns rather than the standard `,` so we change the default separator character. Note if your csv file isn't purely numeric or you wish to use a subset of the columns as features then you should use `CSVDataSource` which allows fine-grained control over the loading and featurisation process of your csv file. There's a columnar data tutorial which details the flexibility and power of our columnar processing infrastructure."

    "## Regression in Tribuo\n",
    "Unlike most ML packages, regression in Tribuo is multidimensional by default. This means that each `Regressor` contains a vector of named values, which like the `Feature` objects are always kept sorted in lexicographic order. However unlike features, `Regressor` objects are dense, they always include all the dimensions, even if some are zero. In practice for an output type this isn't a strong restriction as if you're working in a multidimensional space then all dimensions will usually be present, and there are many fewer output dimensions than there are features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given this difference from other libraries, you might as why Tribuo does it this way? It's because it makes operating on probability distributions using regression algorithms significantly simpler. We do this in Tribuo's implementation of [LIME](https://www.kdd.org/kdd2016/papers/files/rfp0573-ribeiroA.pdf) for classification model explanations, and it will make future implementations of gradient boosting and similar algorithms much easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "How does this affect users of Tribuo's regression package? Well, each `Regressor` is an `Iterable<DimensionTuple>`, and a `DimensionTuple` represents the name of a dimension, along with it's regressed value and a variance if present (unknown variances are set to `Double.NaN`). If you don't name the dimensions during data loading then they are automatically named `DIM-0`, ... `DIM-N` where `N` is one less than the number of dimensions. This means in the common case of single dimensional regression you'll want to access the first element of the various state accessors, or by asking the `Regressor` for `DIM-0`, or index `0`."

    "\n",
    "The root-mean-square error (RMSE) summarizes the magnitude of errors between our regression model's predictions and the values we observe in our data. Basically, RMSE is the standard deviation of model prediction errors on a given dataset.\n",

    "Lower is better: a perfect model for the wine data would have RMSE=0. The RMSE is sensitive to how large an error was, and is thus sensitive to outliers. This also means that RMSE can be used to compare different models on the same dataset but not across different datasets, as a \"good\" RMSE value on one dataset might be larger than a \"good\" RMSE value on a different dataset. See [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root-mean-square_deviation) for more info on RMSE.\n",

Note that R^2 can turn negative when the sum-of-squared model errors (numerator) is greater than the sum-of-squared differences between observed data points and the observed mean (denominator). In other words, when R^2 is negative, the model fits the data *worse* than simply using the observed mean to predict values.\n",
