# Tribuo v4.0 Release Notes (Initial Public Release)

This is the first public release of the Tribuo Java Machine Learning library.
Tribuo provides classification, regression, clustering and anomaly detection
algorithms along with data loading, transformation and model evaluation code.
Tribuo also provides support for loading external ONNX models and scoring them
in Java as well as support for training and evaluating deep learning models
using TensorFlow.

Tribuo's development started in 2016 led by [Oracle
Labs](https://labs.oracle.com)' [Machine Learning Research
Group](https://labs.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=LABS:project_details:0:7), and has
been in production inside Oracle since 2017. It's now available under an Apache
2.0 license, and we'll continue to develop it in the open, including accepting
community PRs under the Oracle Contributor Agreement.

See [tribuo.org](https://tribuo.org) for a project overview, or explore the
[docs](https://github.com/oracle/tribuo/tree/main/docs) here on Github for more
details. We have jupyter notebook based
[tutorials](https://github.com/oracle/tribuo/tree/main/tutorials) demonstrating
various features of the library.
