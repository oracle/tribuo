# Tribuo - A Java prediction library (v4.3)

[Tribuo](https://tribuo.org) is a machine learning library in Java that
provides multi-class classification, regression, clustering, anomaly detection
and multi-label classification. Tribuo provides implementations of popular ML
algorithms and also wraps other libraries to provide a unified interface.
Tribuo contains all the code necessary to load, featurise and transform data.
Additionally, it includes the evaluation classes for all supported prediction
types. Development is led by [Oracle Labs](https://labs.oracle.com)' Machine
Learning Research Group;  we welcome community contributions.

All trainers are configurable using the
[OLCUT](https://github.com/oracle/olcut) configuration system. This allows a
user to define a trainer in an xml or json file and repeatably build models.
Example configurations for each of the supplied Trainers can be found in the
config folder of each package. These configuration files can also be written in
json or edn by using the appropriate OLCUT configuration dependency. Models and
datasets are serializable using Java serialization. 

All models and evaluations include a serializable provenance object which
records the creation time of the model or evaluation, the identity of the data
and any transformations applied to it, as well as the hyperparameters of the
trainer. In the case of evaluations, this provenance information also includes
the specific model used. Provenance information can be extracted as JSON, or
serialised directly using Java serialisation. For production deployments,
provenance information can be redacted and replaced with a hash to provide
model tracking through an external system.  Many Tribuo models can be exported
in ONNX format for deployment in other languages, platforms or cloud services.

Tribuo runs on Java 8+, and we test on LTS versions of Java along with the
latest release.  Tribuo itself is a pure Java library and is supported on all
Java platforms;  however, some of our interfaces require native code and are
thus supported only where there is native library support. We test on x86\_64
architectures on Windows 10, macOS and Linux (RHEL/OL/CentOS 7+), as these are
supported platforms for the native libraries with which we interface. If you're
interested in another platform and wish to use one of the native library
interfaces (ONNX Runtime, TensorFlow, and XGBoost), we recommend reaching out
to the developers of those libraries. Note the model card and reproducibility
packages require Java 17, and as such are not part of the `tribuo-all` Maven
Central deployment.

## Tutorials

Tutorial notebooks, including examples of Classification, Clustering,
Regression, Anomaly Detection, TensorFlow, document classification, columnar
data loading, working with externally trained models, and the configuration
system, can be found in the [tutorials](tutorials). These use the
[IJava](https://github.com/SpencerPark/IJava) Jupyter notebook kernel, and work
with Java 10+, except the model card & reproducibility tutorials which require
Java 17.  To convert the tutorials' code back to Java 8, in most cases simply
replace the `var` keyword with the appropriate types.

## Algorithms

### General predictors

Tribuo includes implementations of several algorithms suitable for a wide range 
of prediction tasks:

|Algorithm|Implementation|Notes|
|---|---|---|
|Bagging|Tribuo|Can use any Tribuo trainer as the base learner|
|Random Forest|Tribuo|For both classification and regression|
|Extra Trees|Tribuo|For both classification and regression|
|K-NN|Tribuo|Includes options for several parallel backends, as well as a single threaded backend|
|Neural Networks|TensorFlow|Train a neural network in TensorFlow via the Tribuo wrapper. Models can be deployed using the ONNX interface or the TF interface|

The ensembles and K-NN use a combination function to produce their output.
These combiners are prediction task specific, but the ensemble & K-NN 
implementations are task agnostic. We provide voting and averaging combiners
for multi-class classification, multi-label classification and regression tasks.

### Classification

Tribuo has implementations or interfaces for:

|Algorithm|Implementation|Notes|
|---|---|---|
|Linear models|Tribuo|Uses SGD and allows any gradient optimizer|
|Factorization Machines|Tribuo|Uses SGD and allows any gradient optimizer|
|CART|Tribuo||
|SVM-SGD|Tribuo|An implementation of the Pegasos algorithm|
|Adaboost.SAMME|Tribuo|Can use any Tribuo classification trainer as the base learner|
|Multinomial Naive Bayes|Tribuo||
|Regularised Linear Models|LibLinear||
|SVM|LibSVM or LibLinear|LibLinear only supports linear SVMs|
|Gradient Boosted Decision Trees|XGBoost||

Tribuo also supplies a linear chain CRF for sequence classification tasks. This
CRF is trained via SGD using any of Tribuo's gradient optimizers.

Tribuo has a set of information theoretic feature selection algorithms which
can be applied to classification tasks. Feature inputs are automatically
discretised into equal width bins. At the moment this includes implementations
of mutual information maximisation (MIM), Conditional Mutual Information
Maximisation (CMIM), minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevancy (mRMR) and Joint
Mutual Information (JMI).

To explain classifier predictions there is an implementation of the LIME
algorithm. Tribuo's implementation allows the mixing of text and tabular data,
along with the use of any sparse model as an explainer (e.g., regression trees,
lasso etc), however it does not support images.

### Regression

Tribuo's regression algorithms are multidimensional by default. Single 
dimensional implementations are wrapped in order to produce multidimensional
output.

|Algorithm|Implementation|Notes|
|---|---|---|
|Linear models|Tribuo|Uses SGD and allows any gradient optimizer|
|Factorization Machines|Tribuo|Uses SGD and allows any gradient optimizer|
|CART|Tribuo||
|Lasso|Tribuo|Using the LARS algorithm|
|Elastic Net|Tribuo|Using the co-ordinate descent algorithm|
|Regularised Linear Models|LibLinear||
|SVM|LibSVM or LibLinear|LibLinear only supports linear SVMs|
|Gradient Boosted Decision Trees|XGBoost||

### Clustering

Tribuo includes infrastructure for clustering and also supplies two 
clustering algorithm implementations. We expect to implement additional
algorithms over time.

|Algorithm|Implementation|Notes|
|---|---|---|
|HDBSCAN\*|Tribuo|A density-based algorithm which discovers clusters and outliers|
|K-Means|Tribuo|Includes both sequential and parallel backends, and the K-Means++ initialisation algorithm|

### Anomaly Detection

Tribuo offers infrastructure for anomaly detection tasks. 
We expect to add new implementations over time.

|Algorithm|Implementation|Notes|
|---|---|---|
|One-class SVM|LibSVM||
|One-class linear SVM|LibLinear||

### Multi-label classification

Tribuo offers infrastructure for multi-label classification, along
with a wrapper which converts any of Tribuo's multi-class classification
algorithms into a multi-label classification algorithm. We expect to add 
more multi-label specific implementations over time.

|Algorithm|Implementation|Notes|
|---|---|---|
|Independent wrapper|Tribuo|Converts a multi-class classification algorithm into a multi-label one by producing a separate classifier for each label|
|Classifier Chains|Tribuo|Provides classifier chains and randomized classifier chain ensembles using any of Tribuo's multi-class classification algorithms|
|Linear models|Tribuo|Uses SGD and allows any gradient optimizer|
|Factorization Machines|Tribuo|Uses SGD and allows any gradient optimizer|

### Interfaces

In addition to our own implementations of Machine Learning algorithms, Tribuo
also provides a common interface to popular ML tools on the JVM. If you're
interested in contributing a new interface, open a GitHub Issue, and we can
discuss how it would fit into Tribuo.

Currently we have interfaces to:

* [LibLinear](https://github.com/bwaldvogel/liblinear-java) - via the LibLinear-java port of the original [LibLinear](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/liblinear/) (v2.44).
* [LibSVM](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/) - using the pure Java transformed version of the C++ implementation (v3.25).
* [ONNX Runtime](https://onnxruntime.ai) - via the Java API contributed by our group (v1.12.1).
* [TensorFlow](https://tensorflow.org) - Using [TensorFlow Java](https://github.com/tensorflow/java) v0.4.2 (based on TensorFlow v2.7.4). This allows the training and deployment of TensorFlow models entirely in Java.
* [XGBoost](https://xgboost.ai) - via the built in XGBoost4J API (v1.6.2).

## Binaries

Binaries are available on Maven Central, using groupId `org.tribuo`. To pull
all the Java 8 compatible components of Tribuo, including the bindings for
TensorFlow, ONNX Runtime and XGBoost (which are native libraries), use:

Maven:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.tribuo</groupId>
    <artifactId>tribuo-all</artifactId>
    <version>4.3.0</version>
    <type>pom</type>
</dependency>
```
or from Gradle:
```groovy
implementation ("org.tribuo:tribuo-all:4.3.0@pom") {
    transitive = true // for build.gradle (i.e., Groovy)
    // isTransitive = true // for build.gradle.kts (i.e., Kotlin)
}
```

The `tribuo-all` dependency is a pom which depends on all the Tribuo
subprojects except for the model card and reproducibility projects which
require Java 17.

Most of Tribuo is pure Java and thus cross-platform, however some of the
interfaces link to libraries which use native code. Those interfaces
(TensorFlow, ONNX Runtime and XGBoost) only run on supported platforms for the
respective published binaries, and Tribuo has no control over which binaries
are supplied. If you need support for a specific platform, reach out to the
maintainers of those projects. As of the 4.1 release these native packages all
provide x86\_64 binaries for Windows, macOS and Linux. It is also possible to
compile each package for macOS ARM64 (i.e., Apple Silicon), though there are no
binaries available on Maven Central for that platform for TensorFlow or
XGBoost. As of the 4.3 release Tribuo now depends on a version of ONNX Runtime
which includes support for macOS ARM64 and Linux aarch64 platforms.  When
developing on an ARM platform you can select the `arm` profile in Tribuo's
`pom.xml` to disable the native library tests.

Individual jars are published for each Tribuo module. It is preferable to
depend only on the modules necessary for the specific project. This prevents
your code from unnecessarily pulling in large dependencies like TensorFlow.

## Compiling from source

Tribuo uses [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) v3.5 or higher to build.
Tribuo is compatible with Java 8+, and we test on LTS versions of Java along
with the latest release. To build, simply run `mvn clean package`. All Tribuo's
dependencies should be available on Maven Central. Please file an issue for
build-related issues if you're having trouble (though do check if you're
missing proxy settings for Maven first, as that's a common cause of build
failures, and out of our control). Note if you're building using Java 16 or
earlier the model card and reproducibility packages will be disabled.

## Repository Layout

Development happens on the `main` branch, which has the version number of the
next Tribuo release with "-SNAPSHOT" appended to it. Tribuo major and minor
releases will be tagged on the `main` branch, and then have a branch named
`vA.B.X-release-branch` (for release `vA.B.0`) branched from the tagged release
commit for any point releases (i.e., `vA.B.1`, `vA.B.2` etc) following from
that major/minor release. Those point releases are tagged on the specific
release branch e.g., `v4.0.2` is tagged on the `v4.0.X-release-branch`.
